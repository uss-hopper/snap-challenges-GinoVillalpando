			<li>Master Branch - this is the final release after all development and would be merged last (no development on this branch ever)</li>
			<li>Develop Branch - this is the basis for almost all new code. you merge into develop when your work is completed for your ticket </li>
			<li>Feature Branch - The branch that you develop on when working on your tickets, they should be small and self-contained.  Frequently, this means one per ticket.
				When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.</li>
			<li>Release Branch - When the feature branch is stable then these are set to release branches, Creating this
				branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point—only bug fixes,
				documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch.
				the release branch gets merged into master and tagged with a version number.</li>
			<li>Hotfix Branch - Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases. They're based on master instead of develop.
				As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop (or the current release branch)</li>
